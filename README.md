# Hello Quantum Arcade Edition

This repo contains all of the html5 web files to run Hello Quanutm Arcade Edition on the web.  This is meant to run on a large screen in portrait mode 2160 tall X 1215 wide.    But iÂ beleieve it will run on something smaller as long as it keeps the ratio.


I have included the basic node server files for being able to run this on a server.  This is neccessary because it will not run unless its served.

To setup make sure you have `node` installed.


Then run

`npm install`

and finally 

`npm start` 

to run locally.  The default is `localhost:3000`.

If you only care about the actual files that are Hello Quantum then seek out the `views` folder.

`cd views` and you will find a folder called HelloQuantum.  In there you will find all of the files that run Hello Quantum.

To see a running example of these files, I have put it up here.

Once you get this running on the touch screen and you think it might need graphic adjustments, please let me know and I will work on getting you an updated version.

If you have any issues or problems, or just want to chat, email me at boland@us.ibm.com

Good Luck!
